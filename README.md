- Today's programming wisdom is to prioritize tasks, plan ahead, and stay organized. This will help you to be more efficient and productive in your coding endeavors.

1. Prioritize tasks: When you are working on a project, it is essential to determine which tasks are the most important and which can be completed later. By prioritizing your tasks in this way, you can ensure that you focus on the critical aspects of the project and not get sidetracked by less significant details. Use a task management tool, such as Trello or Asana, to keep track of your priorities and make sure you stay on track. 
 2. Plan ahead: Planning is crucial when it comes to programming. Before starting a new project or undertaking a complex task, take the time to plan out your approach. Create a detailed plan that includes all the steps you need to take, the resources you will need,and the timeline for completion.This will ensure you have a clear roadmap and can avoid getting lost in the details as you work.  
3. Stay organized: A clean and organized codebase is a joy to work with and will lead to a more seamless development process. Implement version control, like Git,to track changes and collaborate with others. Keep your code well-documented and structured, using well known coding conventions and standards. Regular code reviews can also help identify potential issues and improve the overall quality ofyour work product.

- "Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the universe is winning." - Rich Cook

This quote humorously highlights the ongoing challenge programmers face in creating user-friendly software that can withstand the unpredictable actions of users. It serves as a reminder to continually strive for simplicity, robustness, and effective error handling in our code.
